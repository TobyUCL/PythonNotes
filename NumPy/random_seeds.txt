Every time you import numpy it creates a new random state.
	"state" is a seed but it is different to the numpy.random.seed(), this is because a seed is just an integer but the "random_state" is much larger.

To get the state:
	random_state = np.random.get_state()
To save the state:
	np.save("random_state_name", random_state)
To load the state:
	loaded_random_state = tuple(np.load("random_state_name.npy",pickle=True))
To set the state:
	np.random.set_state(loaded_random_state)
